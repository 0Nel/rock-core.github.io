To register a package in autoproj, you need to basically do two things

 * declare it in an autobuild file
 * add VCS information for it (i.e. "where to get it")

A first step
------------

A quick thing that can be done to register a new package in your autoproj
installation is to add it to the local package set.

 * [register it](package_sets/autobuild.html) in
   <tt>autoproj/local.autobuild</tt>
 * [give version control information](package_sets/importers.html) for it in
   <tt>autoproj/overrides.yml</tt>

Alternatively to the last point, you can register it under the "type: none"
importer in autoproj/overrides.yml to make autoproj not care about updating that
package.

Sharing package definitions with the rest of the world
------------------------------------------------------

To do that, you will either have to move the package definition to a separate
package set (usually one of those that are in autoproj/remotes/), or to create
your own package set]

For the first solution, you will have to move the package definition from
autoproj/local.autobuild to an autobuild file in the package set directory (name
does not matter as long as it ends with .autobuild). Moreover, you will have to
move the importer definition from autoproj/overrides.yml to the package set's
source.yml file.

For the second solution, [read on](package_sets/index.html)
