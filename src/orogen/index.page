What are oroGen and typeGen
---------------------------

oroGen is a specification language and code generator for the Orocos Realtime
Toolkit (RTT). The Orocos/Real Time Toolkit is a C++ library allowing to build
component-based systems (http://www.orocos.org/rtt). The orogen tool allows to
create new components easily.

In oroGen, one write a specification that describes the components you want to
develop. Then, orogen generates the corresponding C++ code and CMake build
system so that you -- the component developer -- has only to care about
implementing the actual functionality.

oroGen has a smaller sibling, typeGen, that can be used to [generate standalone
typekits](type_definitions.html)

In any case, the following documentation is meant

The most important point is that you ***cannot*** use your component/typekit
before you have installed it. So, don't forget to do 'make install'
