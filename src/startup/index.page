This page explains how to install the Orocos Toolchain and where to look for more
information (tutorials, ...)

Installation: the easy way
--------------------------

 1. Make sure that the Ruby interpreter is installed on your machine

    ruby --version
    {: .commandline}

    Important: Rock requires ruby either 1.8.7 or better, or 1.9.2 or better

 2. Create and "cd" into the directory in which you want to install the toolchain
 3. Save the [bootstrap.sh](http://gitorious.com/rock/buildconf-all/blobs/raw/master/bootstrap.sh) script in the folder you just created
 4. In a console, run
    
    sh bootstrap.sh
    {: .commandline}

 5. Important: as the build tool tells you, you **must** load the generated env.sh script at the end of the build !!!
    * source it in your current console

      . ./env.sh
      {: .commandline}

    * but also add it to your .bashrc: append the following line at the end of
      $HOME/.bashrc
    
      . /path/to/the/directory/env.sh
      {: .commandline}

Maintaining a Rock installation uptodate
----------------------------------

Once it is installed, you can update it by going into the root of the
installation folder and do

autoproj update <br/>
autoproj build
{: .commandline}

You might have to reload the env.sh script after that as well. Simply opening a
new console will do the trick
