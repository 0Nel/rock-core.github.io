There are multiple ways to contribute to Rock

First and foremost, you can contribute bugfixes and enhancements to the main
Rock codebase through [the gitorious interface](http://gitorious.org/). Clone a repository, add your changes and create merge requests.

Second, [create your own package
set](/autoproj/advanced/creating_pkg_set.html) to publish your
libraries and components. Once you have put this package set and the code on a
public place (gitorious, github or even a svn-oriented code hosting), drop us a
line on the [rock-dev] mailing list. We would be glad to include it in a (to be
created) third-party package directory.

Finally, once some packages you created are of a sufficient quality, you can
submit them for inclusion in Rock itself. Just drop us a line on the
[rock-dev] mailing list so that we can discuss it.

Generating your own package directory
-------------------------------------

The rock-directory script in
[rock/scripts](http://gitorious.org/rock/scripts.git) allows you to create your
own package directory looking like [the one from
rock](http://rock-robotics.org/package_directory).

To do so, you need to check out the scripts repository, update your path and run
rock-directory:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/rock/scripts.git rock-scripts
    PATH=$PWD/rock-scripts/bin:$PATH
    cd to/your/autoproj/root/dir
    rock-directory ../package_directory

If you plan to publish this directory somewhere, we ask you to change the
directory template. To do so, check it out first from
  
    git://gitorious.org/rock/template-directory

modify the template to match your project/institute/... name (in
src/default.template).

Pass the template as a second argument to rock-directory

    rock-directory ../package_directory ../customized_template
