title: Release Strategy

Rock does **not** have fixed-point release. Or at least, it does not have any
yet.

Rock is maintained on a rolling-release basis. Each package provides three
branches:

 * the 'master' branch on which the development is made
 * the 'next' branch on which changes are applied from 'master' to make sure
   everything works fine before ...
 * .. the 'stable' branch is updated from 'next'

This strategy will be the main release mechanism for Rock. There **will** be
some exceptions, when some in-depth changes require to change a lot of packages
at the same time.

In this case, the changes will be made on a separate branch ('topic branch'),
and tested. Once they are deemed of a good-enough quality, they will be
first publicized to rock-dev and then merged into master (and, later on, to next
and finally to stable).

Since they are pervasive changes, it is important for us that people can prepare
themselves by branching or by avoiding updates for a while, i.e. that they can't
break existing systems unknowingly.
