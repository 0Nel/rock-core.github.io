Orogen plug-in
-----------

To make life easier while using the stream aligner, a orogen plug-in was created.

To use the plug-in one needs to add the following lines to his project.orogen file:

{coderay:: ruby}
     stream_aligner() do
	max_latency(0.1)
	data1_period = 0.01
	align_port("data1_port_name", data1_period)
	align_port("data2_port_name", 0.3)
	align_port("data3_port_name", 0.1)
    end
{coderay}

stream_aligner()
-----------
The stream_aligner() statement will add a instance of the stream aligner to the task base class. 

max_latency(timout)
-----------
The max_latency() statement sets the timeout of the stream aligner. 

align_port(name, period)
-----------
The align_port statement is more complex and will do multiple things at once.   
Note, the given name must match a port name that is defined in the same task context.

First, it will add a property the the task for setting the data period for the given port at runtime. The naming convention of the property is 'port_name'_period. The default value for the property is set to the second argument align_port call.

Second it will add a pure virtual function with the name 'port_name'Callback to the task base class. This function is the replay callback used by the stream aligner and needs to be implemented by the user e.g. you.

Third, it will generate code in the configure hook of the task base class that registers a data stream at the stream aligner for the given port.

Last, it will generate code int the update hook of the task base class, that will poll all data from the given port, feed it into the stream aligner and call the step function.. 

Note that you MUST call TaskBase::configureHook() and TaskBase::updateHook() if you reimplement the hooks.
