title: ... in Roby
sort_info: 240

So far, we have seen the following bits about the transformer:

 * the declaration, in oroGen, of the transformations required to process the data
 * the transformer configuration file
 * the runtime component configuration
 * finally, additional frame information that can be provided at runtime to
   allow proper display

This page will deal with the usage of the transformer in Roby, Rock's system
management layer. We will first see what Roby can do for you when using the
transformer, then how to extend the transformer models to allow full automatic
configuration and how to provide the runtime configuration.

The challenge here is to be able to configure __and reconfigure__ a complete
system by providing the minimal amount of information, as always in Roby.

The need for more
-----------------
Let's take the same example than before: our laser filter (and, for now, only
the laser filter). Conceptually, the processing chain for that filter is:

![Example processing chain](transformer_roby_initial.png)

When doing Ruby scripting, one has to specify 4 frames:
 
 * the frame of the lidar_samples port
 * the input and body processing frames of the laser_filter::Task
 * the frame of the filtered_samples port

However, one can notice that __by construction__, the frames of the
lidar_samples port, the input frame of the laser_filter::Task and of the
filtered_samples ports are all the same.

Moreover, since to get the input-to-body transformation, the laser filter
component will need the output transformation from the servo. The __actual__
needed network on our example system should therefore actually look like:

![Example processing chain with servo](transformer_roby_initial_with_servo.png)

However, the additional servo component is very specific to our system, and is
dependent on the laser filter configuration (a different assignation of frames
to input and body could lead to chains that do not require the servo output, or
chains that would require a different transformation producer).

What we will now see is:

 * how to describe the transformer setup better to reflect the links between
   frames and ports
 * how to select frames in the context of Roby controllers
 * how dynamic transformation producers get added to the final network
   automatically

Additional transformer modelling
--------------------------------
What we have seen in the previous pages are the transformer specification that
are **required** for a component to work. I.e. how to declare the
transformations that our processing needs, and how to use them from the
component implementation.

This part deals with transformer modelling that is meant to **describe** how the
component is implemented. I.e., the declarations that we will discover below
will **not** change the component behaviours. They are merely meant to describe
it.

These declarations can be added in either the component's oroGen file or, if
that file is not available or for convenience reasons, to the Roby . I.e. either
in laser_filter.orogen:

{coderay:: ruby}
task_context "Task" do
  transformer do
    <declarations>
  end
end
{coderay}

or, in models/orogen/laser_filter.rb

class LaserFilter::Task
  transformer do
    <declarations>
  end
end

__When should you do one or the other ?__. One thing to consider, when adding
these declarations, is that by adding it to an oroGen project, you make this
project dependent on the drivers/orogen/transformer package. This is not an
issue when it is already the case, but might be undesirable when adding it to
tasks that otherwise do not require this dependency (such as, in our example,
the lidar and servo tasks).

__To associate a frame to a port__, i.e. to tell the system that a particular port
is expressed in a particular frame, one adds

{coderay:: ruby}
associate_frame_to_ports "frame_name", "port_name1", "port_name2"
{coderay}

where the ports can be both inputs and outputs. In our laser filter, the needed
declaration would be:

{coderay:: ruby}
associate_frame_to_ports "input", "lidar_samples", "filtered_samples"
{coderay}

and in the lidar task, it would be:

{coderay:: ruby}
associate_frame_to_ports "output", "lidar_samples"
{coderay}

__To associate a transformation to a port__, i.e. to tell the system that a
particular port outputs a transformation, one adds:

{coderay:: ruby}
transform_output "port_name", "source_frame" => "target_frame"
{coderay}

For instance, in the servo task, one would add:

{coderay:: ruby}
transform_output "transform_samples", "lower" => "upper"
{coderay}

And now, the result:

Transformer configuration
-------------------------
What we have so far is: a model of each of our component's frames, and how these
frames are linked to the transmitted data.

We're missing two things:

 * a transformer configuration file
 * a way to tell Roby instanciation specification which transformations are
   required in the running network

__The transformer configuration file__ is mostly identical to the one used
normally in Ruby scripts. Assuming that the transformation file is called
config/transforms.rb, one would load it in config/ROBOT.rb (i.e.
config/asguardv3.rb) with

{coderay:: ruby}
Orocos.transformer.load_transformer_conf('config', 'ROBOT.rb')
{coderay}

Additionally, the transformer integration is currently disabled by default, so
you need to add

{coderay:: ruby}
Roby.app.orocos_engine.transformer_enabled = true
{coderay}

In addition, the Roby-transformer integration automatically loads
config/transforms_ROBOT.rb

The only difference with the configuration files used for normal Ruby scripts is
how the transformation producers are interpreted. In Ruby scripts, it was a
task_name.port_name pattern. In Roby, it must map to a definition created with
#define.

For instance, in our running example, one would do

{coderay:: ruby}
dynamic_transform "dynamixel", "lower" => "upper"
{coderay}

in the transformer configuration file, provided that "dynamixel" is the name of
the servo device declared in config/ROBOT.rb

Note that nothing forbids you use a "a.b" name for a define, so you can share
the exact same configuration files between the ruby scripts and the Roby
controllers. Indeed, if the configuration file uses,

{coderay:: ruby}
dynamic_transform "dynamixel.transform_samples", "lower" => "upper"
{coderay}

One would simply do

{coderay:: ruby}
define("dynamixel.transform_samples", "dynamixel")
{coderay}

in the system's main deployment file in config/deployments/

Instanciating networks with transformations
-------------------------------------------

What's left to do is introduce some frames in the system specification.

There are two main type of frames that usually need to be specified:

 1. the frame in which the sensors produce their data (laser and servo in our
    example)
 2. intermediate frames needed for processing  (the body frame in the laser
    filter of our example).

Sensor frames are specified in the device declarations, in config/ROBOT.rb:

{coderay:: ruby}
Robot.devices do
  device(Dev::Lidar).
    frame('laser')
  device(Dev::Servo).
    frame_transformation('lower_servo' => 'upper_servo')
{coderay}

These frames get propagated in the network, and usually lead to having most of
the frame assignations resolved:

![Transformer with most frame assignations resolved](transformer_roby_instanciated_without_body.png)

Finally, one needs to specify in which frame the laser filter should do its
processing. This is given as the same time than one gives #use flags:

{coderay:: ruby}
add(Cmp::TutLaserFiltering).
  use_frame('body' => 'body')
{coderay}

Finally, one can see in the network above that the Servo::Task got added. This
is done __automatically__ because the transformation produced by the servoing
task is required by the laser filter. The laser filtering composition does
__not__ include the servo explicitely !!

However, this also mean that you have no mean to give specific configurations to
the servo. To do that, you need to override the generic transformer
configuration when adding the laser filter composition:

{coderay:: ruby}
add(Cmp::TutLaserFiltering).
  use_frame('body' => 'body').
  use_transformation_producer(
        'lower_servo', 'upper_servo',
        Servo::Task.use_conf('default', 'sweeping')
  )
{coderay}
