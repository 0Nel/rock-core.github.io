The general concept in Syskit, the rock system management layer, is to provide
requirements on what should run, and let the management layer (1) generate the
network that is needed to run it and (2) let it handle the runtime aspects
(configuration / reconfiguration, starting, monitoring)

It would be a __very__ good idea to follow [the
tutorials](../system_management_tutorials/index.html) before you continue with
this documentation.

Components
----------
In Syskit, a _component_ designates a black box
that has inputs and outputs, and can report about its execution. In practice, it
can be:

 * a _task context_, i.e. an actual component that is implemented in C++ using
   oroGen
 * a _data service_, which is an abstract placeholder for "concrete" components
   (compositions or task contexts). More on that later
 * a _composition_, which represents a way to bind components together to form
   a new component

The set of available component models in a system form the so-called system
model. In the system model:

 * [task contexts](task_contexts.html) are automatically imported from oroGen descriptions.
   Because of the [naming convertion rules](index.html#naming_convertion), an
   the Roby model that represents the oroGen task context xsens_imu::Task is
   called XsensImu::Task.
 * [compositions](compositions.html) are defined as subclasses of Syskit::Composition.

~~~ ruby
class CompositionModelName < Syskit::Composition
  <definitions>
end
~~~


 * [data services](data_services.html) are defined using the following code block. This block defines
   a ServiceModelName __Ruby module__ in the current module that represents the
   service model.

~~~ ruby
data_service_type "ServiceModelName" do
  <definitions>
end
~~~

System model files vs. deployment files
---------------------------------------
The files that define system model elements (data services, compositions and
task contexts) are stored in models/blueprints/ and models/orogen/.
