This page will discuss the different ways in which you can define and access
this interface:

 * selection of modalities
 * interactive action selection, through a shell-like interface
 * plan-based action selection, through the creation of plans

In this page, the term "system requirements" is used to represent all what the
system is supposed to run, i.e. everything that has been declared using #add or
#add_mission.

General action interface
------------------------
Roby, the plan management system on top of which the network deployment is
built, offers an **action interface**. This section will briefly describe it.

To add a new action, one 

Changing the system requirements
--------------------------------
Three different operations can be applied to modify the system requirements:

 1. adding a new requirement
 2. replacing an existing requirement by another one
 3. removing an existing requirement

The plan-based interface to the deployment engine will always take care of (3).
What you will have to do is either (1) or (2), and we will now see how.

To **add** a new requirement, one has to inject a
