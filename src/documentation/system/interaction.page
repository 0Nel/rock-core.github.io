title: Running and interacting with a Roby/Syskit system
sort_info: 600
---

Syskit bundles are first and foremost Roby applications. As such, the tools and
methods to interact with a Roby application also apply to the ones that are
using syskit. You should therefore have first a look at what can be done with a
Roby application. In particular, you should look at the [Roby action
interface]({rock_api: roby}/building/actions.html) and the ways [one can interact
with a running Roby application]({rock_api: roby}/interacting/index.html)

What this page is going to be about is how syskit fits inside these concepts:
how [profiles](profiles.html) are mapped to Roby [actions]({rock_api:
roby}/building/actions.html), and what it means to deploy subsystems through
the action interface.

Using profiles as Roby actions
------------------------------
_In fine_, when using syskit, one designs a "master" profile in which all the
behaviours / needed subsystems are defined. This master profile can then be
injected in an action interface class (usually the main interface in
models/actions/main.rb) with

~~~ ruby
class Main < Roby::Actions::Interface
  use_profile MyProject::MyMasterProfile
end
~~~

Deploying subsystems through the action interface
