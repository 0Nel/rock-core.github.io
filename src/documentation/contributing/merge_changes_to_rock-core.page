Abstract
--------
The Rock repositories have been moved from gitorious to github - they can now be
found here: <https://github.com/rock-core>. This tutorial will teach you how to:

 * Create your own working copy of a Rock repository,
 * configure your Rock installation accordingly and
 * create pull requests.

Create your own working copy
----------------------------
To create your own working copy of one of the Rock tutorials, fork the 
_rock-core_ repository - this is done as follows:

Go to the _rock-core_ repository on github - for example 
<https://github.com/rock-core/gui-vizkit3d>. Click "fork" to create your own
working copy of the repository - the corresponding URL will be
_https://github.com/your_name/gui-vizkit3d_.

Configure your Rock installation
--------------------------------
As you are now working on your own forked version of the _rock-core_ repository,
you need to configure your Rock installation accordingly.

First "cd" into your repository and add a new remote:

~~~ text
git remote add your_name https://github.com/your_name/your_repository.git
~~~

Then, "cd" into your _dev/autoproj/_ folder and update the file _overrides.yml_
as follows:

~~~ yml
  - your_repository:
    branch: master
    url: git@github.com:your_name/your_repository.git
    push_to: git@github.com:your_name/your_repository.git
~~~

From now on, changes you make to your repository are pushed to the respective 
branch of your forked repository.

Create pull requests
--------------------
Once you have changed some of the code, tested the result and want to commit
your changes to the corresponding _rock-core_ repository, you need to create
a pull request. The standard procedure is as follows:


 * Go to your forked repository on github.
 * Click _Pull Requests_.
 * Click _New pull request_.
 * You will now see see the changes you committed to your forked repository and 
   which are not yet in the corresponding _rock-core_ repository.
 * Click _Create pull request_.
 * You should give your pull request a meaningful name and enter a comment,
   so that the people checking your pull request easily understand what changes
   you made.
 * Click _Create pull request_. Your pull request will be checked and you will
   receive an e-mail about comments posted or if it has been merged to 
   _rock-core_.
