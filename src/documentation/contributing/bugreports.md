Bug reports are managed [using the Github
interface](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). However, you have to
determine on which package the issue should be created. If you have a doubt,
drop instead an email on [the rock-users mailing list](http://www.dfki.de/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/rock-users).
