Bundles in Rock are collections of all files needed to run a particular robot
system.

In practice, bundles are Rock packages and they - most importantly - contain
the following:

 * ruby scripts (to run sets of components) - contained in the _scripts/_ folder
 * configuration files for oroGen tasks - contained in the _config/orogen/_ folder
 * log files - contained in the _logs/_ folder
 * ...

See [the wiki](http://rock.opendfki.de/wiki/WikiStart/Standards/RG7) for more
information on bundles.

Creating the bundle
-----------------

Bundles cannot created anywhere, just in directories named in the environment
variable <tt>$ROCK_BUNDLE_PATH</tt>. The name of the bundle will be the basename of
the directory created.

~~~
cd $AUTOPROJ_CURRENT_ROOT/bundles
rock-create-bundle my_new_bundle_name
~~~

The name of your bundle should, for logical reasons, equal the name of your
robot. Afterwards, you must tell Rock that this is the bundle you are currently
working on:

~~~
rock-bundle-default my_new_bundle_name
~~~
