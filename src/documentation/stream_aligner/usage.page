Manual Usage
-----------


Input data streams 
-----------

To register a data stream at the stream aligner one needs to specify the following 
arguments:

 * Period
 * * The period in which the data will arrive. Note, this value needs to be smaller or equal to the minimum time between two data samples, as the samples would get dropped otherwise.

 * Callback
 * * A callback function which should be called as soon, as a sample is allowed to be replayed.

 * Buffer size
 * * A upper limit to the amount of data samples that should be buffered for the given stream.

Timeout
-----------

The timeout specifies the global timeout. To say in other word, this determines, how long one stream may delay the replay of all other stream. 

Step function
-----------

In order to replay data, one needs to call the step function. The step function will check, weather 
there is data ready to be replayed. If data may be replayed, the step function calls the corresponding callback and returns true. Note that the step function will at most replay one sample per call.
