All the code needed to bridge ROS and Rock is included in a separate package
set. To enable it, you will need to:

 - have a working ROS installation. The only supported distributions are
   groovy and later. Unfortunately, the catkin build system changed too much
   between fuerte and groovy to allow us to support fuerte.
 - be in an autoproj-based Rock installation

In your autoproj manifest (autoproj/manifest), add

~~~
 - gitorious: rock-ros/package_set
~~~

in the package_sets section and 

~~~
 - rock.ros
~~~

in the layout section. Update and build. If you added this is an existing Rock
installation, you will have to force-build all orogen-based packages with

~~~
autoproj build --force orogen/
~~~
