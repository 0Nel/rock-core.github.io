Currently, the Rock tooling is not able to start and configure ROS nodes by
itself. You still have to use the ROS tooling to manage your ROS nodes.

This page assumes that you are able to start ROS nodes using roslaunch. What we
will see is how to connect a live ROS system with Rock components, as well as
with the rest of the Rock tooling (such as e.g. vizkit)

Connecting ROS nodes and Rock components
----------------------------------------

To be able to connect ROS nodes with Rock components, you must modify your
startup Ruby scripts by adding

~~~ ruby
require 'orocos/ros'
Orocos::ROS.initialize
~~~

For this to work, you will need to have setup the ROS_MASTER_URI environment
variable properly (note: the rock.ros package setup sets it up to the default
local master URI).
