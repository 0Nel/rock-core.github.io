Currently, the Rock tooling is not able to start and configure ROS nodes by
itself. You still have to use the ROS tooling to manage your ROS nodes.

This page assumes that you are able to start ROS nodes using roslaunch. What we
will see is how to connect a live ROS system with Rock components, as well as
with the rest of the Rock tooling (such as e.g. vizkit)

Connecting ROS nodes and Rock components
----------------------------------------

To be able to connect ROS nodes with Rock components, you must modify your
startup Ruby scripts by adding

~~~ ruby
require 'orocos/ros'
Orocos::ROS.initialize
~~~

At the top. For this to work, you will need to have setup the ROS_MASTER_URI environment
variable properly (note: the rock.ros package setup sets it up to the default
local master URI).

Once this is done, the ROS nodes can be resolved by the name service from their
ROS name:

~~~ ruby
ros_node = Orocos.name_service.get '/prosilica_camera'
~~~

The topics to which this node are subscribed are listed as input ports and the
ones it publishes at output ports:

~~~ ruby
ros_node.find_output_port('/prosilica/raw')
~~~

Alternatively, one can get a handle on a topic, and then publish or subscribe a
component port to it:

~~~ ruby
ros_topic = Orocos::ROS.topic('/prosilica/raw')
ros_topic.connect_to task.an_input_port
task.an_output_port.connect_to ros_topic
~~~

This will fail if the topic does not already exist. To create a topic by
publishing / subscribing a port, use #publish_on_ros and #subscribe_to_ros. Note
that these two methods work in case the topics do exist as well. What the method
above provides is protection against typos: it will fail if the topic does not
already exist.

~~~ ruby
task.an_input_port.subscribe_to_ros('/topic/name', connection_policy)
task.an_output_port.publish_on_ros('/topic/name', connection_policy)
~~~

In both cases, a default topic name of task_name/port_name can be used by not
specifying the topic name at all:

~~~ ruby
task.an_input_port.subscribe_to_ros(connection_policy)
task.an_input_port.publish_on_ros(connection_policy)
~~~
