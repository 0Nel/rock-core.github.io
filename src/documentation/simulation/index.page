What is Robot Simulation
----------------
The core idea of integrating a Simulation into rock is the need to offline
evaluate/implement Algorithms. The Simulation provides the ability to calculate
the movement based on actuator targets, and predict (more or less accurate) how
the sensor data look like given the state on the enviorment and the robot
itself. 

Background of the Rock Mars Integration
----------------
Rock currently provides a direct interface to the Mars Simulation. This
Simulation is not directly part of rock. Nevertheless the Mars integration into
rock was done by core-developers to generate a easy was for robot simulation
with Rock.
