What is Robot Simulation
----------------
The core idea of integrating a simulation environment into rock is the need for offline
evaluation/implementation of algorithms. The simulation provides the ability to calculate
movements of a robot based on actuator targets, and to predict (more or less accurate) how
the sensor data would look like given the state of the environment and the robot itself. 

Background of the Rock Mars Integration
----------------
Rock currently provides a direct interface to the MARS Simulation. This
simulation is not directly part of rock. Nevertheless the MARS integration into
rock was done by core-developers to generate an easy way for robot simulation
within the Rock framework.
