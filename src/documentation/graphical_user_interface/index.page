Robots can be very different and so are their user interfaces. To support the
programmer in a flexible way, a ruby library was introduced which brings Rock and
Qt together.

Based on this library there are a number of widgets which can be used to develop
a custom GUI in only a few minutes. For more complicated GUIs custom widgets
can easily be added by implementing the QDesignerCustomWidgetInterface.
