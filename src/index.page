What's the difference with the Orocos Toolchain ?
-------------------------------------------------
The Orocos Toolchain is the standard infrastructure required to build Orocos
components. It contains the real-time toolkit, typeGen/oroGen code generators
and supportive components for deployment and task browsing.

The Orocos/DFKI toolchain is centered around the use of oroGen for component
writing, and the Ruby language for system deployment and data analysis. In
practice, what you get is:

 * use Ruby scripts to start your components and monitor them
 * use a model-based tool for large-scale system deployment, and benefit from
   its logging capabilities to do post-mortem analysis of system behaviour.
 * use the data logger to log all data that your components generate, and use
   Ruby scripts to analyze this load of data
 * benefit from a large component repository
