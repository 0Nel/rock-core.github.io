Get started with the [step-by-step installation guide](startup/index.html).
Reference documentation on [the build system](autoproj/index.html) is also
available, and you can browse the code and contribute on
[Gitorious](http://gitorious.com/rock).

Use it
{: .content-title-noshade-size3}

The toolchain offers a support [from the component
development](orogen/index.html) to [running complete
systems](runtime/index.html). Logging, log replay and data analysis [is also a
very important part](data_analysis/index.html)
Finally, have a look at the [existing packages](/package_directory/index.html).

What is Rock ?
--------------

Rock is, in our opinion, _robot development done right_.

Of course, we are a bit biased ;-)

What rock's main 

 * **sustainable systems**. The architecture and the tools in Rock are designed
   with long-living systems in mind. In practice, it means that for us,
   error detection, reporting and handling is key in any robotic architecture.
 * **scaling up**. Provide the tools to be able to manage big systems with a
   minimum fuss. But we don't require you to learn about these (complex) tools
   right away: as soon as you use rock's component development tool, oroGen, you
   have the guarantee that your components can be integrated from simple
   scenarios using hardcoded C++ behaviours, to Ruby scripts up to the complete
   system monitoring tools.
 * **reusable codebase**. Even though we think that the rock toolchain is one of
   the best out there, some other people might feel differently. And they might
   be right. That's why, in rock, most of the functionality -- from control to
   data display through data processing -- is implemented in a way that is
   totally independent from rock's integration framework. That's right: just
   pick our drivers, localization algorithms and control loops and integrate
   them in **your** integration framework. You don't have to do anything on our
   side, as the code is completely independent from the integration parts.

What's the difference with the Orocos Toolchain ?
-------------------------------------------------
The Orocos Toolchain is the standard infrastructure required to build Orocos
components. It contains the real-time toolkit, typeGen/oroGen code generators
and supportive components for deployment and task browsing.

The Rock toolchain is centered around the use of oroGen for component
writing, and the Ruby language for system deployment and data analysis. In
practice, what you get is:

 * use Ruby scripts to start your components and monitor them
 * use a model-based tool for large-scale system deployment, and benefit from
   its logging capabilities to do post-mortem analysis of system behaviour.
 * use the data logger to log all data that your components generate, and use
   Ruby scripts to analyze this load of data. Replay the data into components
   for testing, or use the Rock UI to display it.
 * benefit from a large component repository

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
**Important for existing Orocos users** The development workflow in Rock does
not encourage the use of the Orocos deployer and of the RTT scripting language.
Since they are both expensive to build, they are by default disabled when you
build the Rock toolchain. However:

 * you can reenable OCL by removing the 'ocl' line in exclude_packages in autoproj/manifest
 * you can reenable the RTT scripting by changing PLUGINS_SCRIPTING_ENABLED from OFF
   to ON in autoproj/overrides.rb
