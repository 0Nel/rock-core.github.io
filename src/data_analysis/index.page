Data Analysis
-------------

The data analysis parts of the Robot Construction Kit covers most of the area
when tooling is needed:

 * you can **log your data**. Logging data is cheap (CPU-wise) in Rock, and can
   mostly always been kept turned on at all times without a great impact on the
   system performance (unless you have I/O problems, obviously). The generated
   log files are **self contained**, which means that the only thing you need
   to read them are the log tools. No other software is required -- i.e. there
   is no need for the modules that generated them to be kept around.
 * you can **replay** logged data using Ruby scripting, with an API that is as
   close as normal component deployment as possible.
 * you can **display** both logged or live data in an uniform manner
