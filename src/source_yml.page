title: Creating a package set
sort_info: 100
---
A package set is made of three things:

 * the description file (source.yml)
 * an optional initialization script (init.rb)
 * autobuild scripts (\*.autobuild)

Autobuild scripts
-----------------
The autobuild scripts lists all the packages defined by this set. It is a
Ruby script (but you don't need to know Ruby to write one). In its most simple
form, it looks like:

{coderay:: ruby}
cmake_package "orocos/rtt"
autotools_package "drivers/imu"
{coderay}

The above snippet defines two packages. The first one uses CMake as a build
system and will be installed in the <tt>orocos/rtt</tt> subdirectory of the
autoproj installation. The second one is an autotools package. There is, for
now, only support for these two build systems, and for Ruby packages. Package
definitions can be tweaked quite a lot, including the ability to generate
documentation. See [the next page](autobuild.html) for more information on how to write autobuild
scripts.

source.yml
----------
The source.yml file gives generic information on the package set itself (most
importantly its name), and version control information (i.e. where to get the
packages). It is a YAML file, and looks like:

{coderay:: yaml}
name: dfki.orocos
constants:
  ROOT_DIR: $HOME/share
  
version_control:
  - "modules/.*":
      type: git
      url: $ROOT_DIR/$PACKAGE.git
  - "drivers/.*":
      type: svn
      url: svn+ssh://rlbsvn.informatik.uni-bremen.de/trunk/$PACKAGE.git
{coderay}

The name field gives a name for the set. It is arbitrary, but the guideline
is to give a name that is java-like for namespaces, i.e. origin.name.

The <tt>constants:</tt> section lists values that can be reused for different
packages. Autoproj defines the HOME constant which is the user's home directory,
and the PACKAGE constant that is the actual package name. We will see later that
these values can also be configuration variables that are asked to the user.

Finally, the <tt>version_control:</tt> section describes how to import each
software package. Its general format is:
{coderay:: yaml}
package_name:
  type: version_control_type # git, svn, cvs, darcs
  url: repository_url
{coderay}

Where package\_name is a regular expression that matches the package name, i.e.
use ".\*" to match all packages for instance. The package name is the one given
to the <tt>blabla_package</tt> stanza in the autobuild file. In the above
autobuild example, the package names are for instance "orocos/rtt" and
"drivers/imu".

For the git importer, one of 'branch' or 'tag' options can be provided as well:
{coderay:: yaml}
package_name:
  branch: branch_to_track
  tag: tag_to_stick_to # it is branch OR tag
{coderay}

The options are applied in order, meaning that the toplevel options override the
lower level ones. In general, one will have a ".\*" entry to give options for all
packages, and then override for specific packages:

{coderay:: yaml}
version_control:
  - "modules/logger": # we don't follow master on this module
      branch: imoby

  - .*: # common options for all packages
      type: git
      url: $ROOT_DIR/$PACKAGE.git
{coderay}

Interaction between package sets definition files
-------------------------------------------
When multiple package sets are used, it is possible to override the version
control definitions in low-priority sets with a higher priority one. Autoproj
has the following rules when searching for version control information:

 * autoproj looks at the package sets *in the order they appear in the
   installation manifest*
 * autoproj searches a relevant version\_control field, and stops at the first
   package set that has one.
 * autoproj *stops searching* at the package set that defines the package.
   Consequence: this set *must* have a version\_control field for it, and an
   error will be issued otherwise.

Using configuration options
---------------------------
autoproj offers a configuration system that allows the user to tweak the build
to its needs. If the version control definitions depend on such configuration
options (as, for instance, because you want to parametrize the importer URLs),
then create an init.rb file next to the source.yml file, and add lines looking
like:

{coderay:: ruby}
configuration_option "option_name", "option_type",
    :default => "default_value",
    :values => ["set", "of", "possible", "values"],
    :doc => "description of the option"
{coderay}

where the option\_type field can either be "string" or "boolean".

Then, you can use the option\_name as an expansion in the source.yml file.

For instance, with an init.rb looking like:
{coderay:: ruby}
configuration_option "MOUNT_POINT", "string",
    :default => "$HOME/nfs",
    :doc => "mount point of the NFS server"
{coderay}

{coderay:: yaml}
version_control:
  ".*":
    url: $MOUNT_POINT/git/$PACKAGE.git
    type: git
{coderay}
