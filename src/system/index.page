Advanced System Deployment
==========================

Roby is a plan management / supervision system. The Rock toolchain offers
a Roby plugin that allows to manage Orocos component networks in Roby, thus
leveraging its supervision capabilities. See [the Roby user's
guide](http://doudou.github.com/roby) for details.

In practice, what does this plugin offers ?

 * have a model-based component deployment. Deploying medium-sized networks of
   components (> 10) is often hard to do right. It is even harder to be sure
   that modifications to the component interfaces will not break the
   deployments.
 * have a model-based adaptation of the component network. While it is hard to
   deploy medium-sized component networks, it is even harder to modify the
   networks while still being sure that you don't break anything.
